\title{Convert to factor, like model}

\description{
Convert factor-like entries in a data structure to factor, with factor as in
\code{factormodel}.}
\usage{
asfactormodel(x, factormodel)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A data structure. Currently only integer vectors or lists of vectors are supported.}
  \item{factormodel}{A data structure to serve as model for the factor specification. Currently, a factor or a vector of type \code{character}.
}
}
%\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
%}
\value{
a data structure of same type as \code{x}, with numeric vectors converted to factors.}

\note{This functionality could go to  \R base function \code{\link{factor}}.

Should be extended to cover a wide range of data structures, and identify substructures for conversion.}
