%- Also NEED an '\alias' for EACH other topic documented here.
\title{Recursive run length encoding.}
\description{
Encode a matrix as  run-length, top down.
Encoding  respects previous runs, e.g line 2 encodes runs in each run of line 1.
}
\usage{rrle(x, collapseNA =FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a matrix.}
  \item{collapseNA}{boolean. Collapse runs of NA.}
}
\details{By default, different NA data are not considered equal. \code{collapseNA} collapses runs of NA in the result. For 
recursion however they are treated as singular data, not as runs. This may need discussion.}
\value{
list of run length encoded lines

\note{This could go to \code{rle} in package \code{base}.

The date structure used for \code{rle} would be better represented as a data.frame.

Run length and other compressions might be implemented in data.frames by default.}
